# Exercise 4 — Share what you built

You have made a skill, an agent, or an MCP configuration.
Publish it to the workshop repository so the rest of the room can use it.

The point is not git. The point is that **publishing is the first thing you
have done in this workshop that other people can see, and that you cannot
quietly undo.** Everything before this was a file on your laptop.

You need a GitHub account. Use ordinary Git plus the GitHub website, or use
the optional `gh` CLI if installed and signed in. A downloaded ZIP cannot
push changes: clone your fork first, or upload reviewed files through GitHub.
Ask an organizer if you would rather not create an account — you can hand
your folder over directly instead.

# Exercise 4a — Decide first: skill, agent, or MCP server?

Before doing the task, answer the question the task raises. You want an
assistant that is good at git. Which of the three does that?

Start in **Plan** mode and ask:

> I want to publish my own skill to a shared GitHub repository as a pull
> request. Should that be an MCP server, a skill, or an agent? Compare them
> for this specific job.

Then compare the answer against this previously considered check list:

| | What it would give you | Verdict for this job |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP server** | `mcp-server-git` is maintained and exposes 12 tools: `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_commit`, `git_add`, `git_log`, `git_checkout`, … | **No.** The earlier workshop measurement was approximately 1,588 tokens of tool definitions: 9.7% of a 16384 budget, 1.2% of 131072 or 0.6% of 262144 (larger budgets require verified server support). Exact cost depends on tokenizer/version and which definitions are sent. It has **no push, no remote and no pull-request tools** in this setup. You would still fall back to `bash`. |
| **Skill** | Guidance: what to check before publishing, what never to commit, which commands in which order | **Yes.** `git` and `gh` already work through `bash`. What is missing is not capability, it is knowing what to check. |
| **Agent** | Permissions: which commands run freely, which need approval, which are refused outright | **Useful.** Inspecting is free; publishing asks; history rewriting is blocked. |

This is exercise 3g's question with a concrete answer. `bash` already covers
git, so the MCP server adds context cost and removes nothing from your plate.
**"There is an MCP server for it" is not a reason to connect one.**

The workshop supplies both of the useful ones:

- [`submit-work`](../../.opencode/skills/submit-work/SKILL.md) — the skill
- [`submit-agent`](../../.opencode/agents/submit-agent.md) — the agent

# Exercise 4b — Look at what you are about to make public

Copy what you are sharing into `submissions/<your-name>/`, then, **in Plan
mode**, with `submit-agent` selected:

> Use the submit-work skill. I want to share the skill I built in exercise 1 (don't write exercise 1, write the name of your skill).
> Show me exactly what would be published and what your checks found. Do not
> commit or push anything yet.

Reading `git status`, `git diff` and `git check-ignore` needs no approval, so
the agent can inspect freely. It should report five things: what would be
committed, that nothing is silently ignored, that there are no credentials,
that there are no large or generated files, and that the submission is
self-contained.

## The check that catches the real mistake

The repository's `.gitignore` is the standard Python one. It excludes these
names **anywhere** in the tree:

```text
build   dist   lib   var   target   venv   env   downloads   sdist   wheels   eggs
```

Name your folder `build` and your submission vanishes. No error, no warning,
`git status` shows nothing to commit, and you find out when your pull request
is empty. This is not hypothetical — exercise 3's scripts were originally in
a folder called `build/` and were silently dropped from the published ZIP.
They are in `scripts/` now because of it.

```bash
git check-ignore -v exercises/04-share/submissions/your-name/*
```

No output is the passing result.

**What to notice:** the agent reporting "committed successfully" and the
files actually being in the repository are different claims. Same lesson as
"a successful HTTP request is not the same as a downloaded structure file" in exercise 1,
and "a query that succeeds is not the same as a correct answer" in exercise 3. Check the thing itself.

# Exercise 4c — Publish it

Switch to **Build** and let it proceed. The fork, push and pull request each
need your approval. With ordinary Git, you create the fork and pull request
on the GitHub website; the agent can prepare the reviewed commit and push.
With optional `gh`, those website steps can be performed through the CLI.

### Ordinary Git + GitHub website

Click **Fork** on the workshop repository. Replace `YOUR-USER` with your fork
owner and `team-01` with your submission folder (or your own name):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/AgenticWorkshop.git
cd AgenticWorkshop
git switch -c submit-team-01
```

Copy your reviewed files into `exercises/04-share/submissions/team-01/` in
this clone, then review and publish only that folder:

```bash
git add exercises/04-share/submissions/team-01/
git diff --cached
git commit -m "Share Team 1 agents"
git push -u origin submit-team-01
```

On GitHub, open **Compare & pull request** from your fork's branch to
`peterwadsackett/AgenticWorkshop`, base `main`. Git manages files and commits;
the website creates the pull request. Authenticate Git using your configured
HTTPS credential manager/token or SSH—not a token committed in a file.

Already working in a clone? Check `git remote -v` and your branch instead of
cloning again. A ZIP has no Git history. Never push another person's staged changes.

**Optional shortcut:** `gh auth login`, `gh repo fork` and `gh pr create`
can handle the website steps. They are conveniences, not prerequisites.

Read each request before approving. The agent refuses force pushes, hard
resets and rebases outright — those are the ones that damage other people's
copies, not just your own.

After creating the pull request, open its URL and check the **Files
changed** tab yourself. That tab is the truth; the agent's summary is just a
claim.

A pull request is a proposal. Someone still has to merge it, and an organizer
will.

# Exercise 4d — Try someone else's skill

Once a few submissions are merged, pull the repository and install one:

> Copy the skill from exercises/04-share/submissions/<someone>/ into my
> project skills folder, then tell me what it does and how to invoke it.

Reopen OpenCode so it discovers the skill, and try it. Read the `SKILL.md`
first: a skill you install is instructions your agent will follow, from
someone you may not know. Treat a downloaded skill the way the workshop tells
you to treat downloaded data — as material to inspect, not instructions to
obey on sight.

**What to notice:** this is why the submission checks matter in both
directions. You checked yours before publishing; check theirs before running.<br>
**The real danger:** Downloaded skills/agents/MCP's can be malicious. You are running
unchecked software from the wild internet. It can be a modern trojan horse.

# Epilogue

You built a skill in Exercise 1, an agent in Exercise 2, and connected an MCP
server in Exercise 3. In this one you decided which of the three your job
actually needed.
