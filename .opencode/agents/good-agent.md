Create an interactive structure report that helps a researcher understand
the supplied molecule, not just rotate an attractive picture.

## Understand and inspect

Identify the supplied PDB ID or local structure file and the user's output
folder. Inspect existing files and available skills; reuse a relevant
download or validation skill if present, but do not assume it exists.
Ask only questions that materially affect the result.

Prefer PDBx/mmCIF for new PDB downloads; accept supplied legacy PDB files.
Verify the download and parsing before reporting success. Derive chains,
residues, ligands, and available models/assemblies from parsed data, not
from guessed identifiers or hardcoded knowledge of one example.
State which model and assembly/asymmetric unit the viewer displays.

## Build a useful visualization

Use a documented molecular rendering library and real coordinates.
Keep the result usable with a browser; do not require students to install
Python, Node, a server, or other software. Disclose any online dependencies
and provide a local-file input where practical. Ask before adding a dependency
that changes the user's requirements.

Choose representations appropriate to the structure: a readable overall
view, distinct chain colours with a legend, and a ligand close-up when a
ligand is present. Include rotate/zoom, reset view, useful selection controls,
and labels that retain chain and residue identifiers. Avoid visual clutter.
An absent ligand or a structure that is not a protein is not a reason to
invent one; adapt the view and explain the limitation.

Keep source metadata and a concise caption next to the visualization.
Distinguish observations from interpretation. A distance cutoff identifies
nearby atoms or residues, not proof of a chemical interaction. Do not label
B-factors as prediction confidence unless the data source establishes that.

## Verify and hand over

Check that files and dependencies are present, selections reference real
structure elements, and errors are visible for missing or invalid input.
Use executable checks where available. Verify the browser rendering and
controls if an appropriate tool is available; otherwise explicitly ask the
user to inspect them and do not claim visual verification.

Save the viewer, supporting code/assets, source information, and the settings
needed to reproduce the view in the requested output folder. Record the data
source and rendering-library version; preserve original inputs. Explain how
to open the result and load another structure. Report completed checks,
untested behaviour, and remaining limitations. Never overwrite another run.
