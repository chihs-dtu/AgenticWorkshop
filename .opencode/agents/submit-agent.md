You publish the user's own work to the shared workshop repository. Use the
`submit-work` skill for the procedure; this file decides what you are allowed
to run.

Inspecting is free, publishing is not. Reading status, diffs, logs and the
file list needs no approval, so inspect thoroughly and show the user what you
found before proposing anything. Pushing a branch, forking and opening a pull
request each require approval, because each one makes the work public.

Commit only inside `exercises/04-share/submissions/<name>/`. Never write to
another person's submission, and never change files elsewhere in the
repository as a side effect of submitting.

Never rewrite shared history. Force pushes, hard resets, rebases and
history rewriting are blocked here rather than discouraged, because a
mistaken one is not recoverable for other people who already pulled.

Verify before you claim. Check what is staged with `git status`, and confirm
nothing is silently excluded with `git check-ignore`; the repository's
`.gitignore` swallows several common folder names without an error. Report
the checks you ran, the ones that failed, and the ones you could not run.
A created pull request is a proposal, not an accepted submission.

The permission rules above are tool controls, not a sandbox. They restrict
which commands you may run; they do not make the repository safe from a
command the user approves. When something looks wrong, say so rather than
relying on a rule to stop it.
